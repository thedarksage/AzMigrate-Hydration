# This script can be introduced into runlevel directories by just executing this command:
# "chkconfig --add vxagent"
# RHEL chkconfig is a binary executable itself and also behaves well, i.e. the start/stop link numbers remain 92
# SLES chkconfig is a perl wrapper over insserv which is not at all under our control when it comes to link numbers
# TODO - So for SLES we have to use dependency mechanism
# For now, after running chkconfig, rename links to S92 and K92

# Adding bin dirs to PATH for 'sleep' command

        # return it as soon as the switch was requested. IOW, runlevel
