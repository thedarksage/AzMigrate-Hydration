How to create the various pem files used by the cxps. This is the
process that was used to create the current pem files. These steps may
change in newer versions of openssl. Check the current openssl docs if
these steps do not work.

The main thing is if creating new pem files, make the expiration date
to be more then the default of 1 year. The current ones are good for
20 years (will expire around 2030).

NOTE:
  + probably should be creating these for each customer and not using
    the same ones

  + the current pem files should not expire until some time in 2030 so
    you should not need to do this

  + assumes this is being done on windows

  + when creating keys, you should be prompted for the following (the
    values shown here are the ones that were used for the current pem
    files) 

      passphrase: inmage
      Country: US
      State: CA
      City: Santa Clara
      Org: InMage Systems
      Org Unit: Scout WEB server
      Comman Name: InMage

  + assumes perl is in your path

* install openssl (if not aleady installed)

* cd to the openssl install dir

* update bin\ca.pl to extend the exipration date by doing the
  following. 

  + serach for $DAYS= update to look like:
 
    $DAYS="-days 7300";  # 20 year
 
  + search for $CADAYS= update to look like:
   
    $CADAYS="-days 7300";  # 20 years

  + search for -sign|-signreq  and update to look like ($DAYS was
    added to override the default expiration date):

      } elsif (/^(-sign|-signreq)$/) {
          system ("$CA $DAYS -policy policy_anything -out newcert.pem " .
                  "-infiles newreq.pem");

* create a subdir for the CA (Certificate Authority)

  mkdir ca

* cd to that dir and do the following

  + create CA (only needed if not already done)

    perl ..\bin\ca.pl -newca

  + generate a certificate request

    perl ..\bin\ca.pl -newreq

  + sign the certificate request

    perl ..\bin\ca.pl -sign

  + copy newcert.pem to host/cxpslib/pem/servercert.pem

  + copy newkey.pem to host/cxpslib/pem/serverkey.pem

  + copy demoCA/cacert.pem to host/cxpslib/pem/client.pem

  + check in those new pem files

* create diffie-hellman key

  NOTE: there should be no reason to recreate this but documented for
  completeness 
 
  openssl gendh 1024 > dh.pem
  
* copy dh.pem to host/cxpslib/pem/dh.pem

* check in dh.pem file
