# exclude dirs
# exclude dirs is for excluding dirs under the allowed dirs in case you want to limit
# certain directories under the allowed dirs. In general these are subdirs of the allowed dirs.
# if you enter a relative dir (i.e. is not a full path), then that subdir will be
# excluded under all listed allowed_dris. If you have more then 1 allowed dir and want
# to exlcude a subdir under a specific allowed dir but not others, then you have to use the full path
# of the exclude dir. Basically if the base name of the full files path matches one of the exclude dir
# then it is not allowed, but still have access to subdirs. If you want to exclude a dir and all its
# subdirs (recursively) then use /* at the end of the dir (dir1/subdir1/*)
#
# e.g. with the following settings
#
# allowed_dirs = /dir1;/dir2
# exclude_dirs = xdir1;xdir2/*;/dir2/xdir3
#
# so the allow_dirs says you can access everything under /dir1 and /dir2 but the exclude_dirs
# refines it such that
#  * the first entry, xdir1, says no access to files in xdir1 under both /dir1 and /dir2 
#    so can not access files under /dir1/xdir1 and /dir2/xdir1 but can still accees subdirs
#    so files are accessible under /dir1/xdir1/subxdir1).
#  * the second entry, xdir2/*, so no access to files in xdir2 nor any of it subdirs for both 
#    /dir1 and /dir2 so can not access anything under /dir1/xdir2 nor /dir2/xdir2
#  * the third entry /dir2/xdir3, says no access to xdir3 under /dir2 only so can not access files
#    under /dir2/xdir3, but can access files under /dir1/xdir3
