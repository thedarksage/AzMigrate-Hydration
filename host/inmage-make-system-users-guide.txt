# Make System #

The make system currently supports Unix/Linux platforms and requires
GNU Make. The kernel code uses its own make file setup and windows
uses Microsoft Visual Studio for building the code.

## Basics ##

Get the entire source from cvs (at a minimum you will need the following)

	cvs -dP :pserver:<userid>@cvs/src co host
	cvs -dP :pserver:<userid>@cvs/thirdparty co thirdparty

cd to the host directory and run

	gmake

Note this document uses gmake as that is the official name of GNU
Make. But on Linux (possibly other) platforms make is gmake. So you
can just run make if you prefer.

By default you will see output for thirdparty packages (we don't
control what they output, just if they need to be configured and
built), gcc default warnings and errors (and success/failure for the
"ar" command).

There are 3 options that you can specify when running gmake.

	1. verbose=no|yes (optional. defaults to no)

		no : do not print commands as they are being executed.
		yes: print commands as they are being executed.

		again this does not affect thirdparty packages being built, you
		will always get what every they normally output

	2. debug=yes|no (optional. defaults to yes)

		yes: create debug version. This includes symbols, defines
		     DEBUG, and puts object files, libraries, and final
		     binaries under their X_MODULE/debug directory.
		no : create release version. This includes symbols (but puts
		     them in a separate file. Note because of optimizations,
		     when using release symbols to debug, don't expect them to
		     be 100% acurate), defines NDEBUG and puts object files,
		     libraries, and final binaries under their X_MODULE/release
		     directory.

	3. warnlevel=none|warn|error (optional. defaults to none)

		none : use the compiler's default warning level. I.e. don't
		       add any additional warning flags.
		warn : adds additional warnings (see section
		       "host/X_ARCH-rules.mak" for details on the additional
		       flags)
		error: same as warn plus treats warnings as errors.

You use them like so

	gmake debug=no verbose=yes warnlevel=warn

You can also make specific modules by listing the target module(s) on
the command line

	gmake <module name> [<module name>]*

In this case the module name is the subdirectory under host

To clean all InMage code run

	gmake clean

To clean specific module(s); both debug and release configurations use

	gmake clean_<module name>_all [clean_<module name>_all]*

To clean a particular configuration leave the _all of the target and
either leave the debug option off for debug configuration or use the
debug option to specify the configuration (note using the debug option
is the only way to clean just the release configuration)

	gmake clean_<modulename> debug=no

To clean all thirdparty packages run

	gmake clean_thirdparty

for individual thirdparty package(s) run

	gmake clean_<thirdparty package name> [clean_<thirdparty package name>]*

where <thirdparty package name> is the name of the thirdparty
packages. In this case the directory is not used. Instead use one
of the following:

	* ace
	* cdk
	* curl
	* openssl
	* sqlite
	* sqlite3x
	* wxwidgets
	* zlib

Finally if you want to clean everything, (thirdparty and InMage) run

	gmake clean_all

Note: when ever cleaning any thirdparty package (no matter what method
was used) it will clean both debug and release as well as do a
distclean. That means the next time you build the cleaned thirdparty
package(s) will be re-configured and rebuilt, both debug and release.

You may also create "tag" files. Note these are not created by default.

for vim run

	gmake ctags

In vim, use :set tags=./tags. Then you may go to the definition of an
identifier with Ctrl-]; pop back with Ctrl-t.

for emacs run

	gmake etags

In emacs, use M-. on the tag to jump to its definition. Pop back with M-*.

## Directory Structure ##

The directory structure uses the following conventions:

   * Platform independent code goes directly under the module
     directory.
   * Code that is major architecture specific but works across all the
     minor architectures goes under that major architecture. This
     corresponds to the X_MAJOR_ARCH make file variable. Do *not*
     include the major architecture name in the file names.
   * Code that is minor architecture specific goes under the minor
     architecture directory. This corresponds to the X_MINOR_ARCH make
     file variable. Do *not* include the minor architecture name in
     file names

Note: you can have platform independent sub-directories under the module
directory. Under those directories you would follow the conventions as
stated above

Generically it is something like this

+ <directory name of your choice>
  + host
    + <module dir>
       all module platform independent code goes here
       + <X_MAJOR_ARCH dir>
          all module X_MAJOR_ARCH specific code goes here (code
          that only works for this X_MAJOR_ARCH, but across all of
          its X_MINOR_ARCHs)
       + <X_MINOR_ARCH dir>
          all module X_MINOR_ARCH specific code goes here
		 + <sub module dir>
          all sub module platform independent code goes here
          + <X_MAJOR_ARCH dir>
             all sub module X_MAJOR_ARCH specific code goes here (code
				 that only works for this X_MAJOR_ARCH, but across all of
				 its X_MINOR_ARCHs)
          + <X_MINOR_ARCH dir>
             all sub module X_MINOR_ARCH specific code goes here
  + thirdparty
     <thirdparty package>

E.g.
a module called mymodule has
   * foo.cpp and foo.h that are platform independent
   * bar.cpp and bar.h that are unix specific but work for all minor
     archs.
   * baz.cpp and baz.h which are minor platform specific

The directory would look something like the following:

+ head
  + host
    + mymodule
      + aix
         baz.cpp
         baz.h
      + hpux
         baz.cpp
         baz.h
      + linux
         baz.cpp
         baz.h
      + sun
         baz.cpp
         baz.h
      + unix
         bar.cpp
         bar.h
      + win
         baz.cpp
         baz.h
      foo.cpp
      foo.h
  + thirdparty
      ...

The following names should used for the architectures.

* Major Architecture
  * All Unices and Linux
      X_MAJOR_ARCH=unix
      * Minor architectures under unix
        * X_MINOR_ARCH=aix
        * X_MINOR_ARCH=hpux
        * X_MINOR_ARCH=linux
        * X_MINOR_ARCH=sun
  * Windows
      X_MAJOR_ARCH=win
      * Minor architectures under windows
        * X_MINOR_ARCH=win

Note: in the future we may need more then just "win" for the windows
minor architecture. E.g. win32 or win64

There maybe rare cases where the code under the major architecture
directory works for most of the minor architectures but where there is
at least one minor architecture that needs its own implementation. In
this case, besides having the file under the major architecture
directory with the implementation, a file of the same name is created
under all the minor architecture directories. For those that need
their own implementation you would add it in that file. For those that
can use the major architecture implementation, they would just include
the file from the major architecture directory.

E.g.
you have a file called example.cpp that works on all Unices but not on
Linux. You would create the following (leaving all other info out
but example.cpp)

+ head
  + host
    + mymodule
      + aix
         example.cpp
      + hpux
         example.cpp
      + linux
         example.cpp
      + sun
         example.cpp
      + unix
         example.cpp

* In the unix/example.cpp you would have the full implementation code
  for unix.
* in the linux/example.cpp you would have the full implementation
  code for linux
* in aix/example.cpp, hpux/example.cpp, sun/example.cpp, you would have
  the following

    #include "../unix/example.cpp"

The reason this is needed is so that the modules make file uses the
correct file(s) when building. See the section X_MODULE/Makefile for
details on including the correct files when building.

Note: There are other ways to handle this issue, but this seemed to be the
simpliest to implement and maintain in the long run.

## Make Framework ##

The make frame work consists of several files:

	* GNU Makefiles
         o Makefile
         o once.mak
         o top.mak
         o bottom.mak
         o thirdparty.mak
         o rules.mak
         o <X_ARCH>-thirdparty.mak
         o X_ARCH.mak
         o X_ARCH-rules.mak
         o <X_MODULE>/Makefile

	* scripts
         o gcc-depend
         o get-specific-version-info
         o thirdparty_links.sh
         o find-dir-deps
         o validate-modules-set
         o is-generated-header
         o <thirdparty dir>/inmage_config_build

The X_ARCH represents the OS and architecture gmake is running
on. This is a generic name not the specific distro name and generic
machine architecture. E.g. Linux_i686 is the architecture name on
Linux 32-bit distros.

The X_MODULE represents the individual modules that will be made. This
is just the name of the various projects under host. E.g. config,
common, s2, etc. They correspond to the directory name for that
module.

<thirdparty dir> is the thirdparty package directory

### GNU Make Files ###

#### Makefile ####

The Makefile is the top level Makefile that drives everything. It
specifies which modules should be built when running make.

If you add a new module that needs to be made, you will need to add
its name to either the REQUIRED_BY_ALL_MODULES variable or the MODULES
variable.

There is a check to see if the X_ARCH was specified on the command
line. This is used for projects where the X_ARCH target is different
then the X_ARCH of the current machine. This so that you get the
correct X_ARCH-rules.mak, X_ARCH.mak and X_ARCH-thirdparty.mak
files. This is used for cross platform builds (see the section "Cross
Platform Builds" for more details) E.g. to build for brocade
you would run  (note the X_ARCH and X_SPECIFIC are just examples the
actual values may vary)

		gmake X_ARCH=brocade X_SPECIFIC=brocade_1.2.3_g++_4.0.1

If you are working on a project where you need to use a different
X_ARCH, you would add that architecture check to this file to make
sure the correct files and modules are used.

See Makefile for details.

#### once.mak ####

The once.mak is included by the top level Makefile. It contains
several settings that only need to be done once. This file needs to be
modified only when adding some feature to the make system that will be
needed by all platforms and is platform independent.

This is where the product version number is specified. If you
need to override the current version number, you may do this:

    gmake X_VERSION_MAJOR=5 X_VERSION_MINOR=0 \
        X_VERSION_PATCH=3 X_VERSION_QUALITY=RELEASE


#### top.mak ####

top.mak is included at the top of each module's Makefile. It sets up
various variables needed for the make process that change depending on
the individual module. In general, you should not have to make any
modifications to this file. This file needs to be modified only when
adding some feature to the make system that will be needed by all
platforms and is platform independent.

See top.mak for details.

#### bottom.mak ####

bottom..mak is included at the bottom of each module's Makefile. It
sets up various variables needed for the make process that change
depending on the individual module. But needs to do this after other
variables have been set. This file needs to be modified only when
adding some feature to the make system that will be needed by all
platforms and is platform independent.

See bottom.mak for details.

#### X_ARCH-thirdparty.mak ####

X_ARCH-thirdparty.mak is just a simple file that includes the
thirdparty package make file that builds the thirdparty packages
needed for this X_ARCH. If one exists that does what is needed,
included it in this file. If one does not exist you will need to create
one and include it in this file.

See one of the X_ARCH-thirdparty.mak files for details.

#### thirdparty.mak ####

thirdparty.mak contains the rules to make all the thirdparty
packages. This is used as most platforms want to make all the
thirdparty packages.

If there are some platforms that need to build a different set of
thirdparty packages, then a new thirdparty.mak (with a name that
reflects its' needs) should be created.

See thirdparty.mak for details.

#### rules.mak ####

rules.mak contains the rules and actions that will be taken to build
the source code. It is included at the end of each X_ARCH-rules.mak
file.

If for some reason these rules don't work on a particular platform
then a rules.mak for that platform should be created.

See one of the rules.mak files for details

#### X_ARCH.mak ####

X_ARCH.mak is included by bottom.mak and allows you to set some X_ARCH
specific variables. If you are porting to a new X_ARCH, then you will
need to create a X_ARCH.mak for that X_ARCH and set
the variables appropriately.

	* X_OBJEXT - specifies the object extension (if any) to use
	* X_LIBPRE - specifies a library prefix (if any) to use
	* X_LIBEXT - specifies a library extension (if any) to use
	* X_EXEEXT - specifies an executable extension (if any) to use
	* X_MAJOR_ARCH - specifies the major architecture of the X_ARCH
	* X_MINOR_ARCH - specifies the minor architecture of the X_ARCH

For variables that are not needed, set them to blank.
E.g. traditionally Linux executables don't have an extension so
X_EXEEXT is set to nothing as follows:

	X_EXEEXT =

See one of the X_ARCH.mak files for details.

#### X_ARCH-rules.mak ####

X_ARCH-rules.mak contains the X_ARCH specific rules used in the
rules.mak that is included at the end of this file.

It will also include platform specific options that maybe needed by
one or more modules when building on this platform.

You need to create one for each X_ARCH that the make system will run
on. You can copy an existing one and make any needed changes for the
specific X_ARCH.

See one of the X_ARCH-rules.mak files for details

#### X_MODULE/Makefile ####

This is the file you will most likely deal with the most. Each module
gets its own Makefile. It determines exactly what code will be
compiled and if the final result is an executable or a library. It
also specifies all the specific platform independent settings for this
module. Platform dependent settings would defined in in the
X_ARCH-rules.mak file and the variable would be used in this file.

If you are adding a new module you will need to create a Makefile for
that module. The best way is to just copy another module's Makefile
and modify it as needed. Don't forget to add the new module's name to
the top level Makefile to make sure it gets made.

Let's cover the complete Makefile

You must include top.mak and it must appear before anything else in
the file (except for any comments).

	include top.mak

Add all the source files that need to be compiled to SRCS. If there
are sources under the major and/or minor architecture directory then
you will need to use the X_MAJOR_ARCH and/or the X_MINOR_ARCH
variables. E.g.

	SRCS = mysrc1.cpp \
		mysrc2.cpp \
		$(X_MAJOR_ARCH)/bar.cpp \
		$(X_MINOR_ARCH)/baz.cpp


Add all module specific include directories and special compiler
platform independent flags (e.g. additional defines) needed to
X_CFLAGS. For including files from other modules you don't need to
specify the full path. Just start with the module directory. If you
are using thirdparty headers, don't forget to use the thirdparty
include variables. See the file that is included by the
X_ARCH-thirdparty.mak for a list of the thirdparty include
variables. Also check the X_ARCH-rules.mak CFLAGS to avoid
duplication as well as for any plaftform specific options you may want
to use in the module's makefile. If needed you may also need to add
X_MAJOR_ARCH and or X_MINOR_ARCH E.g.

	X_CFLAGS = -DMY_DEFINE \
		-Iconfig \
		-Iconfig/$(X_MAJOR_ARCH) \
		-Iconfig/$(X_MINOR_ARCH) \
		$(ACE_INCLUDE)

Add host module specific libraries to X_LIBS. This is for host module
libraries only. This is only needed when building a binary executable. When
specifying the libraries use the module name (i.e. the directory name)
of the library. You do not need to specify any paths. Do not use the
the -l option before the library name. E.g.

	X_LIBS = \
		config \
		common

Add thirdparty libraries to X_THIRDPARTY_LBIS. Use thirdparty LIBS
variable to specify the thirdpary libraries to use. E.g.

	X_THIRDPARTY_LIBS = \
		$(ACE_LIBS) \
		$(CURL_LIBS)

Add all module specific system libraries to X_SYSTEM_LIBS. This is
only needed when building a binary executable.  These are the system
libraries that will be found in the default library search
path. Often they are platform specific so you usually need to create
a special variable in all the X_ARCH-rules.mak files. You don't need
to specify the library dir, just the library name. In this case you
use the standard library option of -l<name> with out the prefix nor
the suffix. You should also check the X_ARCH-rules.mak SYSTEM_LIBS to
avoid duplication and for any existing variables for these
libraries. E.g. if you need to link against the ncurses library (which
is platform specific) you would specify

	X_SYSTEM_LIBS = $(LIBCURSES)

Add all module specific platform independent linker flags to
X_LDFLAGS. Make sure to check X_ARCH-rules.mak LDFLAGS to avoid
duplication. Also add platform specific linker flags. Currently
no modules have any specific LDFLAGS, so it is left empty. E.g

	X_LDFLAGS =

Set the BINARY and BINARY_EXT appropriately for the type of binary
being generated. Make sure to use the values X_EXEEXT for executables
and X_LIBPREE and X_LIBEXT for libraries. E.g. an executable would use

	BINARY = dataprotection
	BINARY_EXT = $(X_EXEEXT)

and a library would use

	BINARY = $(LIBPRE)config
	BINARY_EXT = $(X_LIBEXT)

Finally, always include bottom.mak last (except for any comments you
may want to add at the end)

	include bottom.mak

See any one of the module Makefiles for details.

### Scripts ###

#### gcc-depend ####

gcc_depend.sh uses gcc to generate a gmake rule that includes all the
dependencies needed by each source file. It puts that rule in a
<outdir/source file name>.d file that is included by the
X_ARCH-rules.mak file. This tires to make sure that any changes to
dependencies causes the correct things to be compiled and linked.

#### get-specific-version-info ####

get-specific-version-info is used to combine the distro and gcc
versions into a single name that is used as part of the full path
location for thirdparty libraries.

#### thirdparty_links.sh ####

thirdparty_links.sh is used to setup links to the thirdparty packaged
needed when building installers as they assume specific locations.

#### find-dir-deps ####

find-dir-deps is used to find all the directories for a given
thirdparty package that has source code. That list is added to that
thirparty packages build rule so that if any code is changed under
those directories, that thirdparty pacakage's build will be run.

#### validate-modules-sets ####

validate-modules-set is used to make sure that all the needed modules
are being built prior to a given module needing it. If there are any
missing modules, it will list the missing modules and report it as an
error. 

#### is-generated-header ####

is-generated-header is used to determine if include paths are missing
in a modules files. It will report an error indicating that if it is
not a generated header file. It alos provides information on how to
correct this issue. 

#### <thirdparty dir>/inmage_config_build ####

<thirdparty dir>/inmage_config_build is used to configure and build thirdparty packages.

## Thirdparty Packages ##

Thirdparty packages are configured and made (release and debug) using
the inmage_config_build script located under the thirdparty directory.

The inmage_config_build script will configure and make both release
and debug versions. I.e. there are no options to tell it to just build
release or debug.

Once inmage_config_build is run, any additional runs will skip the
configuration and just run make. If you need to re-configure (this is
needed at times when trying to get the inmage_config_build script
working for new and/or updated packages), you can run

	./inmage_config_build --clean

and then run

	./inmage_config_build

If you make changes a thirdparty source file you can just run

	./inmage_config_build

from the thirdparty directory. That will re-make the thirdparty
package picking up the changes.

If you do make a change to thirdparty source files, then make sure to
send out a special email (i.e. more then just the check-in email that
is automatically sent) informing everyone that they will need to
update their thirdparty directory. It would be best if the email
included just the files that were modified so that one could just
update those files with out having to check everything.

Once you have the updates, then running the top level make file should
cause any thirdparty package that had changes to be rebuilt. If for
some reason you do not see that happen (besides reporting the
issue), you can can either do a gmake clean for those thirdparty
packages or before running the top level make, first run

    <thirdparty package dir>/inmage_config_build

That will re-make the thirdparty package picking up the changes. Then
you can run gmake.

If you need to add or upgrade a thirdparty package then you will need
to make sure you set it up correctly. This assumes you are not porting
anything to a new platform. If you are porting to a new platform see
the section "Porting to a New Platform".

First you need to make sure the thirdparty package will build
correctly. To do that requires an inmage_config_build script to be
setup correctly for that thirdparty package.

If you are upgrading, copy the existing inmage_config_build from a
previous version of that thirdparty package and update it as needed
for the new version

If you are adding a new thirdparty package, then you can copy an
inmage_config_build script from another thirdparty package and modify
it. Note you should test if the new thirdparty package allows you to
run configure from a subdirectory or if it needs to alwasy be run in
the top level directory. This is important as the inmage_config_script
does different things depending on running in a subdir or the top level
dir. The ace inmage_config_build script is an example of a thirdparty
package that lets you run configure in a subdir. While the zlib
inmage_config_build script is an example that requires you to run
configure from the top level directory.

Note when modifying the inmage_config_build script, each thirdparty
package does things slightly differently so you need to pay close
attention to how the thirdparty package you are trying to build works
and modify the script accordingly. There are too many variables to
give all the details in this document, but the things to look at in
the inmage_config_build script would be

	* variables being exported from the script
	* --options used when running ./configure (or ./config)
	* gmake command line options being used

Check the thirdparty package's documentation for details.

After you have the inmage_config_build script ready to go you need to
make sure it works correctly. You can do this by just running

	./inmage_config_build

If there are no errors you should be done. If there are errors you
will need to figure out what the problem is and try again. In that
case you should run

  ./inmage_config_build --clean
  ./inmage_config_build

Once you have the inmage_config_build script working correctly you
need to do the following:

	1. look in all the X_ARCH-thirdparty.mak files to find all the
		files that they inlcude.
	2. edit each of the files found in step 1 to reflect the
		thirdparty package information correctly
		* For an upgraded package, update the existing ROOT variable
		  and possibly the  _LIBS variable to reflect any new or
		  renamed libraries
		* For a new package create new variables and rules using the
		  existing ones as a guide

Check in all your changes.

You should now be ready to use the thirdparty package.

## Porting To A New Platform ##

If you need to port to a new platform follow these steps

	1. set up your new platform. Make sure that GNU Make 3.8 or
		later and gcc 3.3.3 or later, automake 1.9.6 or later,
		autoconf 2.61 or later, m4 1.4.10 or later, and libtool
		1.5.26 or later are all available. If you need to
		install any of them, grab the latest versions.

	2. get all the code from cvs

You should now be ready to use that platform.

## Cross Platform Builds ##

At times you may need to do a build on one platform but target a
different platform. This is referred to as cross platform build. This
is very similar to porting to a new platform, but does have some
differences.

The biggest difference is the scripts used to determine the X_ARCH and
X_SPECIFIC (obtained by the get-specific-version-info script) will not
be correct as they will return the values for the platform you are
building on and not the target platform values. In that case you need
to tell the make system those values when you are running make. This is
done by providing the X_ARCH and X_SPECIFIC values on the command
line. These values don't have to actually match the ones from the
target machine, but should be unique to the target platform. E.g. for
brocade you could use

	  X_ARCH=brocade
	  X_SPECIFIC=brocade_<brocade_version>_g++_<g++version>

where
	<brocade version> is the version of the brocade switch that is
	being targeted.

	<g++version> is the version of the cross compiler being used.

This way you could build for 2 different brocade versions on the same
machine if you needed to do different things for different brocade
versions.

You can also use the specific target platform values if you want. You
can get them as follows.

to get the X_ARCH value you would logon to the target platform and run

   shell uname -ms | sed -e s"/ /_/g"

The output will be used for the X_ARCH.

To get the X_SPECIFIC value depends partly on the actual target
platform. You will need to use what ever method is provided by the
target platform for reporting the platform version. See the
get-specific-version-info script for the various ways that is
determined for the various platforms listed. Note ignore the
gccVersion portion as that will be obtained from the actual cross
compiler being used.

Finally to get the gcc version, logon to the platform where the build
will be done. Run the cross compiler that will be used giving it the
option to report the version. E.g. if using a GNU cross compiler you
would just run the compiler.

	/usr/local/mycrosscompiler/g++ --version

You want just the version number.

Now that you have the version info from the target platform and the
compiler version you need to combine them into a single string to form
the X_SPECIFIC value. This is done as follows

	 <specific platform version><compiler name><compiler version>

where
	<specific platform version> is the version info you got from the
	target.

   <compiler name> is the name of the compiler used. E.g. g++. You
   don't need to full path just the binary name.

   <compiler version> is the version number reported.

Note you need to replace all spaces with underscores ('_').

Now you have X_ARCH and X_SPECIFIC

To build you would run the following

	gmake X_ARCH=<arch> X_SPECIFIC=<specific>

where <arch> is the value you got for X_ARCH and <specific> is the
value you got for X_SPECIFIC as described above.

As with porting to a new platform, you need to create the proper files
for this cross platform.

	1. set up your new platform. Make sure that GNU Make 3.8 or
		later, your cross compiler (and any additional tools needed
		for cross compiling), automake 1.9.6 or later, autoconf 2.61
		or later, m4 1.4.10 or later, and libtool 1.5.26 or later are
		all available. If you need to install any of them, grab the
		latest versions.

	2. get all the code from cvs

	3. if needed, create a new X_ARCH-rules.mak for the target
		platform using the X_ARCH name that you plan to use when
		invoking make.

	4. if you needed to create a new X_ARCH-rules.mak, then you need
		to create a new X_ARCH.mak

   5. if needed, create a new X_ARCH-thirdparty-rules.mak that will
  	   build all the thirdparty packages needed for the target
  	   platform.

   6. if you needed to create a new X_ARCH-thirdparty-rules.mak, then
     	you need to create a new X_ARCH-thridparty.mak file that
     	includes the new X_ARCH-thirdparty.mak

	7. At a minimum need to modify the thirdparty
		inmage_config_build scripts for this new platform.

		The main modification is to make sure that the proper
		compiler options are setup. Search for

		    echo platform $SYSTEM not supported yet

		You need to add a case statement to that case construct that
		properly sets the compiler options that are being set in the
		exiting cases. In this case (no pun intended) the label will
		be the same as the X_ARCH that is being used when building.

		That means even if you are doing cross builds for mulitple
		targets from the same machine, you will need to add a case
		statement for each individual X_ARCH that is being used.

      If this platform doesn't need a particular compiler option
		just set the variable to blank. E.g we use the -nosse2 option
		for linux, but that is only valid for intel/amd ia32/x64
		instruction set. So for sun it is set to blank as follows

		    NOSSE2=

	   After adding support for this platform, make sure that all
		the thirdparty packages that will be built by the
		X_ARCH-thirdparty.mak actually build. If any fail you will
		need to get them to build. That may require additional
		modifications to the inmage_config_build script. Make sure
		you don't break it for the existing platforms

	8. If this plartform is going to build a different set of
		modules then the default one, you need to update the top
		level Makfile to check for the specific X_ARCH and create
		MODULES variable that lists all the modules needed for this
		platform. E.g.

		ifeq (brocade,$(X_ARCH))
			  MODULES : = $(REQUIRED_BY_ALL_MODULES) brocadehelper brocadetst
	   else
			   MODULES := $(REQUIRED_BY_ALL_MODULES) common s2libs  ...
		endif

		Note you should also check the REQUIRED_BY_ALL_MODULES
		variable to make sure what is listed is really required for
		this platform. If there is any modules listed there that are
		not need, then remove them from that variable and add them to
		all MOULDUES lists that have REQUIRED_BY_ALL_MODULES
		listed. Or if the list is short, just leave the
		REQUIRED_BY_ALL_MODULES off of this platforms MOULDES list
		and list them inidividually.

	9. run gmake X_ARCH=<arch> X_SPECIFIC=<specific> as described above.

  10. fix any issues

Check in all your changes.

You should now be ready to use that cross platform.

## Bugs/Features ##

The make system uses more dependency checking then some maybe are used
to. It not only checks dependencies for executables, libraries,
objects, source and header changes, it also checks against changes to
the make files and scripts themselves. That way any changes will cause
the proper thing to be done without having to do a clean and rebuild
everything. E.g. if you change a module's Makefile, you will see that
module re-compiled and linked. If you change a top level make file or
script, you may see the whole system being rebuilt.

However, being that this is a work in progress, it is likely that
somethings have been over looked. There may also be some feature(s)
that are missing. E.g at one point the make system did not support
Makfiles in subdirs of modules. That has since been fixed. Or you have
to be in the top level directory when runing gmake.

So if you notice things not working as they should

	* most importantly things not getting built that should have
	  (especially after something was changed). I.e. the dependency
	  checks are missing things.

	* things being built that didn't need to be after some change

	* missing feature

	* etc.

report them in Bugzilla using the component "Make System" so that they
can be fixed.
