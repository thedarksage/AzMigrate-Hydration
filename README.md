# Project
This project provides the source code for [Azure Migrate hydration scripts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/prepare-for-agentless-migration#hydration-process).
Hydration provides the capability to patch a VM disk brought onto azure with the necessary configuration changes to make the VM bootable on Azure, and necessary adjustments made > for VM to be acquire a connectable state on Azure platform. Hydration aditionally makes confiuration changes to make VM Azure environment friendly by redirectly the console output to Azure's [Serial Console](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/serial-console-overview), and install the [VM Guest agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/agent-linux), required for VM extensions and post deployment configuration of a VM.

# Requirements
The scripts available in this repository can only be used through Powershell with [Az Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-7.2.0#:~:text=%20In%20those%20situations%2C%20you%20can%20install%20the,manually%20copy%20it%20to%20other%20machines.%20More%20) installed.

The script doesn't copy contents from OnPrem hypervisor VMs to an Azure Managed disk. It expects customers to have an actiove subscription on azure with the disk contents present on an Azure managed disk.

For a Linux VM which is originally based out of Hyper-V hypervisor, it is possible for the VM to have [Hyper-V LIS components](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/supported-centos-and-red-hat-enterprise-linux-virtual-machines-on-hyper-v) missing. Before bringing the disk to Azure, it is expected for these components to be installed on the VMWare/Other hypervisors based VMs for hydration to work properly.

Some features may require additional internal tools such as:
1. dracut/mkinitrd, lsinitrd in Linux VMs if Hyper-V LIS modules are missing in kernel image.
2. dhclient/dhcpcd in Linux VMs if networking rules are not configured to DHCP.
3. Python 2.6+ for installation of Linux Guest Agent. [Read additional basic requirements here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/agent-linux#requirements). It's preferred to have setuptools appropriate for the python version installed on the OnPrem machine, but it's not a blocker.
